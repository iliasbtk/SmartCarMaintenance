				This app helps you manage your car’s maintenance and track the costs. You are able to track your car maintenance schedules such as oil and filter changes, tire rotations, brake checks and brake fluid changes,
				interim and full services. In addition, the app notify you about important expiring insurance, MOT, and road tax, and optionally any subscriptions such as parking permits. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				First you enter your vehicle registration number: the car’s MOT history and road tax information is pulled from DVLA’s website. This includes the year of manufacture, year of acquisition,  make of the car,
				and type of fuel. After that you have to enter your current mileage, date of last (i) full service (ii) interim service (iii) oil change, (iv) brakes changes, (v) filter change. You’re then prompted to enter 
				your current insurance details : expiry details, and policy number. Finally, you’re required to enter any other subscription services such as parking.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				Based on the information above, the app creates a maintenance schedule and sets up reminders for upcoming services and expiring documents. With the exception of MOT and road tax, the user needs to manually
				input each task performed such as services, document renewals or any other expenses. Mileage can be entered manually, but is also made available on a yearly basis from the MOT history of the car. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				Car expenses are tracked by the app: this requires manual input from the user for fuel costs, fines, parking tickets, MOT tests, insurance premium, services and repair, which can then be visualized in the
				form of tables and graphic charts. This app can also be used by professionals such as taxi drivers or a tradesperson who uses a vehicle in their job (e.g. van) as the app allows them to track the per mile
				monthly and yearly costs of using the vehicle. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				Another feature of the app is a map that displays nearby fuel stations, garages, and MOT test centres (one of these places of interests at a time) using the Google Maps JavaScript API. Finally, the management
				of multiple vehicles by a single user of the app is also supported.
